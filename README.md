# PersonalWebsite

## This is v1.5ish of my portfolio website

I want this to be a professional tier website I can use to display my projects by the end of the semester. 
I have been working on learning the p5.js library, and I want this to be a platform where I can host and link to projects I have done, on top of it being itself a showcase of my web development skills. 
In the interest of that, the first large change from my initial version of the website (done on my laptop) was to figure out a way to embed and style a sketch I did earlier this week.
